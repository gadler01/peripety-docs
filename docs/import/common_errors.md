## Device

Rack does not exist

This error is caused by the rack name in the data you are importing not aligning with a rack name record in Peripety. This means you either have a typo or the rack itself does not exist in Peripety.

## Interface

Device does not exist

This error is caused by the device name in the data you are importing not aligning with a device name record in Peripety. This means you either have a typo or the device itself does not exist in Peripety.

Interface already exists/duplicate interfaces

This, in most cases, is from a device having expansion slots occupied by network cards or child devices that have ports of the same name. The solution to this problem is to go into the cable tab and add slot prefixes to each of the ports with the same name. 

## Cables

This error is caused by the interface name in the data you are importing not aligning with an interface record in Peripety. This means you either have a typo or the interface itself does not exist in Peripety.
