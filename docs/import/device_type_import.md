# Device Type Import

## Manufacturers

The first step of importing the data into Peripety is to update the device type library with any undocumented makes and models. Navigate to the manufacturer list in the device_type tab of the import helper spreadsheet.

![Manufacturer List](../img/import/manufacturer_list.png)

Open Peripetys manufacturer table alongside the device_type tab and compare the data.

![Manufacturer Split Screen](../img/import/manufacturer_split_screen.png)

Search the manufacturer page for the manufacturer name.

![Manufacturer Search](../img/import/manufacturer_search.png)

For manufacturers that already exist in Peripety, check the spelling and formatting and change data in the device tab to reflect existing Peripety data.

![Manufacturer Find and Replace](../img/import/manufacturer_find_replace.png)

For manufacturers not in Peripety, add them to the database and change the data in the device tab to reflect existin Peripety models and spelling.

## Device Types/Models

Locate the model list.

![Model List](../img/import/model_list.png)

Open Peripety's device type table alongside the spreadsheets device_type tab.

![Model Split Screen](../img/import/model_split_screen.png)

Often the model name provided by the client is not the full model name so it is important to research the correct name if you don't know what the full name is off hand.

![Check Model Name](../img/import/check_model_name.png)

Search the device type page for the full model name by using ctrl + F or the search bar.

![Model Search](../img/import/model_search.png)

For device type models that already exist in Peripety, check the spelling, formatting, and U height and change the data in the device tab to reflect Peripety's models.

![Model Find and Replace](../img/import/model_find_replace.png)

For models not in Peripety, add them to the database and change the data in the device tab to reflect Peripety's models and spelling.
